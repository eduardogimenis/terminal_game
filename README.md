# terminal_game
Simple terminal game in order to learn C++

The game started with just a few simple requesites, but I am challenging myself to work on this part time, and see where I get.
So far I have a few classes, and a very simple gameplay loop (that does not feel like gameplay).
It can generate a very simple level layout, and the code is reasonably documented.

My plan is to get the game functional in with several systems.
The goal is to also continue being a terminal game for the moment, and implement lovecraftian literature.
This is because I want a way to convey emotion through text, and I think lovecraftian is the most straightforward way,
it needs less words, vaguer senteces, and to build an atmosphere. Which I believe it is easier done over text than with images.
