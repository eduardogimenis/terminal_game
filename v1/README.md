version 1. Has okay use of classes. Still no good design princinples but gets the job modeteratively done.
it also includes more documentation.
things to add:
- [ ] better level generation (more dynamic)
- [ ] implement backpack and item classes with player class
- [ ] implement an event system that triggers based on something
  - [ ] use a design patter for it (one-to-many?)
